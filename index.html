<h2>HOME</h2>
            <h3>Gone are the days when the librarian had to have his library log updated manually with help of his assistants.The tedious process of updating the log, manually, after every transaction is dying out in most of thelibraries. This is with the advent of computerization in this field too.Then came spreadsheets which used to run for pages. Even then it was the duty of thelibrarian/administrator to enter all details manually in the spreadsheet. She/he had to keep track of all itemsin the library and update the corresponding records. The person borrowing the book had to get hisverification card and get it updated every time he borrows/returns an item from/to library. Even this work of verifying the person and updating the card falls on the librarian or his assistant. Every now and then thelibrarian has to keep track of all the books and other items by checking the stocks (i.e. stocking).</h3>

<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
   <h3> This solution is developed using PHP which improves the accuracy of the information by leapsand bounds. This solution helps the administrator accomplish his tasks at ease. This solution is an onlinelibrary management system which lets users sign-up to the library initially and then sign-in every time theywant to find some item in the library. The user can also maintain and edit his profile details.It also lets administrators manage the library from their desktop. They can monitor any item, its stock andother related information. A user can sign-in and search for items, borrow or reserve items if they are presentin the library. If not, user can request the librarian/administrator to get the book by furnishing all the details.As soon as a user reserves a book the library database gets updated automatically. This improves accuracyand leaves no user fooled about the status of availability of an item. All details of the user are stored in thedatabase which eases pressure on the administrator about defaulters. Defaulters can be blocked/removedfrom the library, by the administrator.The user need not visit the library every time to find an item; instead he/she can search items from his/her own PC/laptop. Reports can also be generated for individual items or for number of defaulters and thenumber of transactions for an item or by a user. They can also be generated in graphical form.An advantage of this solution is that a web browser which supports .net framework is enough to view theuser interface. This interface can be seen in any such system and hence makes it portable too.</h3>
